\emph{Please add an extra page, where you explain the modifications and describe
  how the points raised in the panel synthesis have been addressed (max. 1 page,
  not within the page limit). In addition, if possible, the resubmission should
  be based on the initial proposal by highlighting in a different colour any
  changes or additions that were made to the initial version. Please be aware
  that the re-submitted project will be evaluated by the same standards as “new”
  applications and in the competition of the new call. Thus, even if all points
  raised in the first synthesis have been addressed, the project might not be
  retained for funding.

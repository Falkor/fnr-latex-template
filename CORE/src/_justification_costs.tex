The budget details proposed in the Excel appendix covers the University of
Luxembourg (UL)/SnT contribution to the project for a total of
\textbf{XXX}\euro{} which is requested for funding to the FNR via the FNR CORE
program.
\\
It is distributed in the following way: 

\begin{description}
  \item[Personnel costs.]~\\
    These costs correspond to the Human Resources (HR) required on the
    project. More specifically, the following staff will be working on the
    project and funding is required from the FNR:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item One post doc full time (\texttt{UL-NN-PostDoc1} Research Associate)
        during 2 years (from $M_{x}$ to $M_{y}$) ) is requested to work on WPX "xx"
        and to a minor extend to WPY "yy"
      \item One PhD full time (\texttt{UL-NN-PhD1} PhD Student)
        during 3 years (from $M_{x}$ to $M_{y}$) ) is requested to work on WPX "xx"
        and to a minor extend to WPY "yy".
      \item Two master trainees (\texttt{UL-NN-Master1} and
        \texttt{UL-NN-Master2} for a total of 12 PM) are also planned, one on
        year 2 (from M14 to M20), the other on the year 3 (from M26 to M32) in
        order to support the project on WP5 "xx" but also to enable the transfer
        through education 
    \end{itemize}
    These human resources are fully dedicated to research activities. All WPs
    are affected by their contributions, yet this HR funding is key for the
    success of the project as:
    \begin{itemize}
      \item argument 1
      \item argument 2 etc.
    \end{itemize}
    All human resources are in accordance with the rates of the University of
    Luxembourg/SnT (UL/SnT). The cost related to permanent positions, i.e. XX
    Professors and YY Research Scientist for a total effort of ZZ PMs, will be
    covered by the UL/SnT.

  \item[Equipment \& Other Costs]~\\
    XX notebooks will be funded by the FNR for the research associate newcomers.
    Also, a set of HPC accesses (High Performance Computing) has been
    provisioned on the UL clusters for XX. This access will be in charge of the UL. 


  \item[Travel cost]~\\
    The FNR defines a yearly lump-sum allowances for traveling abroad for every
    projects, computed as follows: (Total PM*2000\euro{}/12).
    blah blah


  \item[Overhead]~\\
    The University of Luxembourg is now authorized to request an overhead of
    25\% of the direct costs (excluding sub-contracting).

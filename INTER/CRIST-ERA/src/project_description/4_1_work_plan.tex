As mentioned in the section~\ref{sec:desc}, \project is divided into
six work packages:
\begin{enumerate}
  \item Project/Configuration Management and Quality Control
  \item ...
  \item Validation on a concrete case studies.
  \item Dissemination of the results
\end{enumerate}

The tasks in the different work packages are designed to be iterative and at a
given level, most of them can be done in parallel.

WP1 and WP6 are classical management tasks.\\
WP2, WP3, WP4 will constitute the main advances in terms of scientific contributions.
WP5 contains a set of tools for driving the needs in terms of business
scenarios, validation of the different approaches and demonstration purposes,
first on reference benchmark applications, then on a real case study in the
Bioinfo domain.
The rest of this section details the work packages mentioned above.
